To use, download the latest WormAssay binary (or build from source, below) and run the application. Simply run the application and attach a camera. Use the Options menu to choose an algorithm and to choose the proper orientation of the plate so that it appears with A1 in the upper left on screen. We have had excellent results screening B. malayi with the Canon Vivia camcorder attached via IEEE1394 (FireWire) and white LED lights illuminating the sides of the plate in a dark box, recording the plate from below (i.e. dark-field for maximum contrast). Any HD or better camera supported by QuickTime should work equally well. CSV output files will be stored in your Documents folder (use the Options menu to customize.) See the manuscript for more information on recording conditions. 

(See the manuscript at PLoS NTD titled "WormAssayâ€¦" for a description of which algorithm to choose. In short, if you have a single parasite in the plate, try using the Optical Flow algorithm. Otherwise, you should probably use the Luminance Difference algorithm.)

Version 1.7.2
-------------
Update DeckLink SDK to 15.3. This requires Desktop Video version 14.3 or newer.
Update minimum macOS version to 14 Sonoma.
Exclude continutiy cameras (i.e. iPhone) when build-in cameras are disabled.

Version 1.7.1
-------------
Disable library validation as this breaks BlackMagic library use. 

Version 1.7.0
-------------
Fix 96 well plate detection.
Fix uninitialized variable bug that could affect output of yellow alignment failure circles,
and either not show them or show them with low quality. This wouldn't affect actual plates or worm data.

Version 1.6.5
-------------
Add Info.plist key to permit AppleEvents to work again on recent macOS versions
(due to security improvements) so that the user is prompted when first sending an email.
Improve AppleScript/Automation failure alert messages.
Covert to using @synchronize and NSOperationQueue instead of libdispatch for locking and
(a higher level abstraction for) queue work, respectively for improved maintainability.

Version 1.6.3
-------------
Use Vision (built-in macOS library) for barcode reading, and remove zxing-cpp project.

Version 1.6.2
-------------
Dark mode support on macOS Mojave and later (minor changes to make logging text readable.)
Remove unused framework dependencies, deprecated build settings and update XIB files to current formats

Version 1.6.0
-------------
Update OpenCV modules used to final 2.x version (2.4.13.6). This is the final version that we will ever upgrade to
to allow for forward and backwards reproducibility of the analyzers. Thus, just the pertinent components of OpenCV
have been copied into this project to fix the algorithim in time. (Changes to the heuristical methods of later OpenCV
revisions add minor variation which reduces reproducibility. With a sufficient powerful comptuer that can process all
frames in real time, there should be essentially complete reproducibility or a close approximation if some frames must
be dropped to keep up in real time.)
Update zxing-cpp to 1.1.1.
Remove unnecessary OpenGL blitting code.

Version 1.5.3
-------------
Fix mac OS 11 BigSur crash on launch due to missing NSCameraUsageDescription privacy key.
Update built in camera detection to work with newer Apple Silicon hardware and be manufacturer
dependent when API is available.
Fix code-signing and notarization.

Version 1.5.1
-------------
Update DeckLink SDK and build settings to build a universal binary for ARM in addition to x64.
Fix OpenGL crash on macOS 11 BigSur. 

Version 1.4.4
-------------
Update code base to build on Mac OS X 10.13+ and remove deprecated code references.
Fix benign misordering in Assay Analyzer menu item text.

Version 1.4.3
-------------
Add menu item to make video saving optional 

Version 1.4.2
-------------
Fix rare crash ("-[__NSDictionaryM removeObjectForKey:]: key cannot be nil") when two videos where finishing encoding
simultaneously.

Version 1.4.1
-------------
Add experimental time lapse feature with menu item UI (defaults to off), and ability to customize default intervals.
Fix build settings so the project builds without warnings in Xcode 5.1.

Version 1.4 (same as 1.3.6)
-------------
Update readmes and credits and bump version number to reflect stability.
Fix regression caused by using latest version of cvCalcOpticalFlowPyrLK(), which affected Optical Flow scoring between
1.3.3 and 1.3.5. The original version is restored and will be used to preserve cross version scoring regardless
of changes/regressions in the OpenCV algorithms.

Version 1.3.4
-------------
Fix video encoding stalls which led to plate tracking loss.
Add metadata to saved video files to indicate orientation of saved videos.
Update OpenCV to 2.4.7 (under BSD license)
(this and later versions require Mac OS X 10.9 for video saving API use.)

Version 1.3.3
-------------
Support video files with non-square pixels.
Use color Canny algorithms.
Update OpenCV to 2.4.6 (under BSD license) and ZXing to 2.2 (under Apache license).

Version 1.3.1
-----------
Optimized selection of frames for use in the Consensus Luminance algorithm to make them more independent
of variations in hardware performance. Note: this results in MMU scores for Consensus Luminance that are 50%
higher than before and cannot be compared to runs before this version (e.g. 1.0-1.2). The Optical Flow algorithm is unaffected.
Support for Blackmagic DeckLink capture devices.
Switch from QTKit to AVFoundation (requires Mac OS X 10.7).
Encode and save videos in real-time which processing instead of queuing the raw data for future encoding.
This removes the dependency on ffmpeg and lowers disk I/O.

Version 1.2
-----------
Add option to disable well finding.

Version 1.1
-----------
Fix bug preventing use of non-HD DV cameras. 
Switch build tools to LLVM and enable ARC. Convert code base to use ARC. 

Version 1.01
------------
Stop preventing rotation of barcode camera, to improve barcoding results. 
Improve barcoding reliability. 

Version 1.0
------------
Change version number to 1.0 to reflect manuscript publication and application release (the algorithms are
numerically equivalent to the versions in 0.15).
Reverse Optical Flow vector calculation direction (from prev. frame to current frame, to current frame to prev.
frame, to make blue edge outline correspond to worm better. This will have no effect on data or noise.)
Fix free space display in console.
Don't write SD on real-time preview of 48 or 96 well plates to avoid overlapping labels. 

Version 0.31
------------
Limit barcode reading to common formats to improve accuracy.
Add more error handling to barcode reading code.
Improve plate rotation handling.

Version 0.23
------------
Don't rotate the barcode camera (using the menu setting.)
Add elapsed time indicator on preview view.
Limit UVC (i.e. barcode camera) resolution for best performance/computability; has no effect on Firewire/other cameras. 

Version 0.20
------------
Add support for column major ordering (an Options menu setting).
Improve plate jostling detection performance. 
Ensure that at least 100 ms elapses between frames analyzed by optical flow so that sensitivity does not vary with
hardware performance (on future faster hardware.)

Version 0.15
------------
First completely functional revision. Both luminance difference and optical flow algorithms implemented and
focused validation against human assay completed.

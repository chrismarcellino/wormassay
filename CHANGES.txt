Version 1.4.4
-------------
Update code base to build on Mac OS X 10.12+ and remove deprecated code references.
Fix benign misordering in Assay Analyzer menu item text.

Version 1.4.3
-------------
Add menu item to make video saving optional 

Version 1.4.2
-------------
Fix rare crash ("-[__NSDictionaryM removeObjectForKey:]: key cannot be nil") when two videos where finishing encoding simultaneously.

Version 1.4.1
-------------
Add experimental time lapse feature with menu item UI (defaults to off), and ability to customize default intervals.
Fix build settings so the project builds without warnings in Xcode 5.1.

Version 1.4 (same as 1.3.6)
-------------
Update readmes and credits and bump version number to reflect stability.
Fix regression caused by using latest version of cvCalcOpticalFlowPyrLK(), which affected Optical Flow scoring between 1.3.3 and 1.3.5. The original version is restored and will be used to preserve cross version scoring regardless of changes/regressions in the OpenCV algorithms.

Version 1.3.4
-------------
Fix video encoding stalls which led to plate tracking loss.
Add metadata to saved video files to indicate orientation of saved videos.
Update OpenCV to 2.4.7 (under BSD license)
(this and later versions require Mac OS X 10.9 for video saving API use.)

Version 1.3.3
-------------
Support video files with non-square pixels.
Use color Canny algorithms.
Update OpenCV to 2.4.6 (under BSD license) and ZXing to 2.2 (under Apache license).

Version 1.3.1
-----------
Optimized selection of frames for use in the Consensus Luminance algorithm to make them more independent of variations in hardware performance. Note: this results in MMU scores for Consensus Luminance that are 50% higher than before and cannot be compared to runs before this version (e.g. 1.0-1.2). The Optical Flow algorithm is unaffected.
Support for Blackmagic DeckLink capture devices.
Switch from QTKit to AVFoundation (requires Mac OS X 10.7).
Encode and save videos in real-time which processing instead of queuing the raw data for future encoding. This removes the dependency on ffmpeg and lowers disk I/O.

Version 1.2
-----------
Add option to disable well finding.

Version 1.1
-----------
Fix bug preventing use of non-HD DV cameras. 
Switch build tools to LLVM and enable ARC. Convert code base to use ARC. 

Version 1.01
------------
Stop preventing rotation of barcode camera, to improve barcoding results. 
Improve barcoding reliability. 

Version 1.0
------------
Change version number to 1.0 to reflect manuscript publication and application release (the algorithms are numerically equivalent to the versions in 0.15).
Reverse Optical Flow vector calculation direction (from prev. frame to current frame, to current frame to prev. frame, to make blue edge outline correspond to worm better. This will have no effect on data or noise.)
Fix free space display in console.
Don't write SD on real-time preview of 48 or 96 well plates to avoid overlapping labels. 

Version 0.31
------------
Limit barcode reading to common formats to improve accuracy.
Add more error handling to barcode reading code.
Improve plate rotation handling.

Version 0.23
------------
Don't rotate the barcode camera (using the menu setting.)
Add elapsed time indicator on preview view.
Limit UVC (i.e. barcode camera) resolution for best performance/computability; has no effect on Firewire/other cameras. 

Version 0.20
------------
Add support for column major ordering (an Options menu setting).
Improve plate jostling detection performance. 
Ensure that at least 100 ms elapses between frames analyzed by optical flow so that sensitivity does not vary with hardware performance (on future faster hardware.)

Version 0.15
------------
First completely functional revision. Both luminance difference and optical flow algorithms implemented and focused validation against human assay completed.

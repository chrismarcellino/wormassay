ordered tasks:
IMPROVE ? MOTION/EDGE ALGO?
LOGGING/OUTPUT SYSTEM
FIX 480p video accuracy


DIFFERENCE ALGORITHM IN WELLS
==============================
***** LUM DELTA *VS* PER CHANNEL DELTA *VS* EDGE MOVEMENT ENERGY FUNCTION (idea is to edge->gaussian->lum)
*ALSO MUST MEASURE EDGE CONTENT IN WELL FOR WELL EMPTY/OCCUPIED CALCULATION
CAPTURE DATA FOR EVERY FRAME DELTA normalized (plus time delta) and post process statistically
Encode time of day in UTC and local time in data and video file name

REPORTING
==========
REPORT    ("MOVING PLATE/CAMERA") WHEN THAT OCCURS __DURING__ A READ
log n seconds (nn frames) captured
REPORT RAW DATA IN SEPARATE FILE

MISC
=====
HELP UI WITH GOOD/BAD EXAMPLES OF HEIGHT, FOCAL LENGTH, FRAME FILL, LIGHTING (With don't show this again, which happens automatically after 3 tries). Also recommend DV (4:3) mode: Approx 1.55 Megapixels (1440 x 1080)

LIVE DEBUG TEXT AND LOGGING FOR WORM AREA AND dA/dS
Prevent sleep, prevent quit, prevent time machine, etc.
ALERT ON LAUNCH IF HARDWARE HAS WEAK RAM OR CPU**
SHOW SYSTEM ALERTS MODALLY self dismiss that don't stop progress but speak and play alarm sound every 5 seconds

MODAL MSALERTS (auto dismiss countdown)
=============
DISK SPACE 90% FULL
"PLATE EMPTY OR LIGHTING ERROR" (adjust lighting, backing)

Allow choice of save location, but fall back and default to Documents/$BinaryName

WARN ON EXIT IF NOT IDLE
EMAIL SETTINGS


















HYPOTHETICAL PAPER
====================
state machine flow chart (make OO)

describe whole system, e.g. division, motion, drawing, real time preview,
plate independent well dertmination
negative conditions (glare, lighting, backdrop, distance/focal length)
empty wells

How can I get acquainted with OpenCV fast?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Look at samples.
2. Look at some web guides

    * http://web.archive.org/web/20060715011915/http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/resources/courses/robotics/doc/opencvdocs/ref/OpenCVRef_ImageProcessing.htm
    * stavens_opencv_optical_flow.pdf 

3. Using C/C++ interpreter Ch to run OpenCV

    * http://www.softintegration.com/products/thirdparty/opencv/demos/ 

4. Within Visual Studio you may load OpenCV workspace:

    * opencv.dsw for Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0
    * opencv.sln for Miscrosoft Visual Studio .NET 2003
    * cbuilderx/opencv.bpgr for Borland C++ BuilderX
    * select cvsample project, build it and run. Look into the code and modify it as you wish. 

5. Also, scan through reference manuals - they contain some example code as well.

6. Search OpenCV archives at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV for the topic you are interesting in.

7. Create a new project from scratch or modify existing cvsample. There are
   application wizards for Microsoft Visual Studio that create OpenCV-aware
   projects; look for them at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV (Files section
   - you have to be registered OpenCV@yahoogroups.com user)
